# Covid-Monitor
and iOS app that monitors for Covid-19 using an Apple Watch

This app utilizes Sp02 and Pulse data recorded by an Apple Watch Series 6 and machine learning to monitor for Covid-19. Even when not being used, the app will periodically run in the background and monitor for signs that the user has become infected with Covid-19. The app will notifiy the user if it determines with high probability that the user might have contracted the virus. 

Covid Monitor first requires the user give permission to access their health data recorded by their Apple Watch. The app also asks for permission to send alerts to the user if Covid-19 is ever detected.
